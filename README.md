Project Description: Data Pipelines with Python

The objective of this project is to build an automated data pipeline using Python to extract, transform, and load (ETL) billing data from multiple sources into a structured format that can be used for efficient analysis and revenue reporting by telecom companies. The dataset used for this project includes three sample billing datasets (dataset1.csv, dataset2.csv, and dataset3.csv) that contain missing values and outliers.

The guidelines for creating the data pipeline are as follows:

Define the requirements of the data pipeline, including the source and destination of the data, the type of data that needs to be processed, the transformations that need to be applied, and the output format.

Use Python to read the CSV files and extract the data.

Perform data cleaning on the extracted data to remove any missing values and outliers. For example, you can replace missing values with an appropriate value or remove them altogether.

Apply any necessary transformations on the data, such as data type conversion, data aggregation, and data filtering, to prepare the data for analysis.

Join the different datasets into a single dataset that can be used for analysis.

Load the transformed data into a database or a file, such as a CSV file, that can be easily analyzed.

Automate the data pipeline by scheduling it to run at a specific time, such as daily or weekly, so that it can update the analysis data automatically.

Test the data pipeline to ensure it produces the correct results. This can be done by comparing the results with the expected output or using a test dataset.

Optimize the data pipeline to improve performance and reduce errors. This can be done by optimizing the code, parallel processing, and reducing the data size.

Monitor the data pipeline to ensure that it runs smoothly and that there are no errors or issues.

By following these guidelines, you will be able to build an efficient and reliable data pipeline that can extract the billing data from multiple sources, transform it into a structured format, and load it into a database or a file for analysis and revenue reporting.

The GitHub repository for this project will contain a Python file or Jupyter notebook with the code for building the data pipeline. The repository will also include a README file with the project description, instructions on how to run the code, and any additional information related to the project.
